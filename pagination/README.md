# Pagination Project

This project shows how to divide datasets into smaller parts, which is called **pagination**

## What you will learn

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and implement simple pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- Use hypermedia pagination, which includes helpful metadata like the current page, next page, and previous page.
- Handle pagination in a way that remains accurate even when data is deleted from the dataset.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.9 (this project is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).
- The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python (use the `pycodestyle` tool to check the code style).
- All functions and methods are clearly explained with documentation.
- You will use a dataset called `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`, which contains popular baby names and related details.
